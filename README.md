Designed and developed a complete web platform from scratch, starting with creating a user-centered layout in Figma. Focused on a clean, modern design, I then built the site using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring responsiveness and a smooth user experience across devices. The project highlights my ability to manage the full development cycle, from initial design to a fully functional and visually appealing website.
